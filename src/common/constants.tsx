Solid attributes are items that are determined by the information we collected on the pages before this and will apply to all fans NFT's who tickets meet the criteria (ex. all users at NYC show get the empire state building in the back). Lottery attributes are sweepstakes of sorts that you can offer to users and are randomized based on qualifications you decide (more on this later). First we are going to define the solid attributes then we will do the lottery attributes.";
